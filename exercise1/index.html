    <h1> How to Brainstorm </h1>
     <p> Brainstorming is one of the most common types of informal idea invention. Brainstorming comes in handy in many situations where creative, cognitive thinking is required. Whether you're coming up with an idea for a new product for your business or you want to come up with a concept for your next oil painting, this wikiHow article can help you get those creative juices flowing. </p>
    <h2> In a Hurry? </h2>
      <p> The best way to brainstorm is to create a mind map to connect your ideas. Spend some time free-writing to get your idea juices flowing, and ask yourself questions that get to the heart of the issue. Always keep your goal in mind, and outline any requirements, especially if someone else will be evaluating your work. For brainstorming techniques and more ideas on how to get inspired, read on! </p>
    <h2> Part 1 <br /> Creating Your Road Map </h2>
      <img src="images\one.jpg">
    <h4> 1. Look at your goal </h4>
      <p> Before you look at what you want to do, think about what you're trying to achieve. This can give you a good starting point, a sort of light at the end of the tunnel. </p>
    
      	<ul>
      		<li> Do you want to brainstorm for your business? </li>
      		<li> Are you trying to come up with an idea for you next work of art? </li>
      		<li> Maybe you're trying to come up with an idea for an article you have to write? </li>
      	</ul>
    <!--imgtwo-->
    <h4> 2. Understand any requirements. </h4>
      <p> If you have a teacher, boss, client, or someone that will be evaluating your work, find out what they're expecting or what they need. If not, just think about the limitations you must work within and what the final product should accomplish. While breaking requirements can sometimes result in a better experience and final product, knowing all of the limitations will give you a good framework to start working in. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> For example, do you need to keep to a certain budget? </li>
        <li> Do you need to use only certain materials? </li>
        <li> Does the project need to be done by a certain time? </li>
      </ul>
    <!--imgthree-->
    <h4> 3. List out and evaluate your assumptions. </h4>
      <p> You'll naturally be assuming some things about your project. What are people looking for? What are your limitations? What is acceptable or normal? What should it generally look like? List these assumptions so that you can play on them later. </p>
      <ul> 
        <li> For example, with an art project, we might assume that people are looking for a particular color scheme that fits with the theme of a gallery show. </li>
        <li> For a business project, we might assume that customers are wanting a particular something that our competitor's product does not provide. </li>
    <!--imagefour-->
    <h4> 4. Evaluate what you have to work with. </h4>
       <p> Take a hard look at what you've done in the past, what you've done already, and what you have available to you in terms of resources. This will help give you some boundaries to work with. </p>
       <ul>
         <li> What kind of tools do you have to use? </li>
         <li> What materials or people have you not made use of in a long time? </li>
         <li> What was something you tried last year and how could it be better? </li>
         <li> Ask others for their opinions. </li>
       </ul>
    <h2> Part 2 <br /> Getting Inspiration
     <!--imgfive-->
    <h4> 1. Do some research. </h4>
      <p> Do some research on what people working on similar projects have been doing. Google is your friend in this adventure. You should not be looking at what others are doing in order to copy them. Instead, you should be seeing where their ideas fall short or what pieces of their project might fit into yours. </p>
     <!--imgsix-->
    <h4> 2. Look at what the innovators are doing. </h4>
      <p> Once you see what run-of-the-mill folks are doing, find out what the innovators are doing. Seek out the cutting edge and fringe ideas or techniques that other people are experimenting with. You might want to similarly experiment! Such innovation can set you apart, making what you do unique, memorable, and appealing. <p>
     <!--imgseven-->
    <h4> 3. Go somewhere. </h4>
      <p> Get outside of your usual environment. This is a great way to break yourself out of the standard creation loop and think of things that you've never thought of before. Go for a walk, go to a local artisan or farmer's market, or work in a cafe for awhile. Any change of environment can help you think in different ways. </p>
     <!--imgeight-->
    <h4> 4. Keep a journal next to your bed. </h4>
      <p> Always have a journal next to your bed. You'll also want to keep a waterproof note-taking option in your shower area. Good ideas often sneak up on us when we're doing these other activities, but then get lost as we get distracted with whatever else it is we're doing. By having a pen and paper nearby, you'll be able to quickly jot down the things you think of before they fly away! </p>
     <!--imgnine-->
    <h4> 5. Take breaks. </h4>
      <p> It's important to take breaks, to keep your mind clear of negative response loops. A lot of the time, when you're thinking and coming up with nothing, you get too focused on the fact that you're coming up with nothing, making it impossible to really think. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Try having a healthy snack, catch up with a coworker, or do a quick chore (such as cleaning up your mess from dinner).</li>
      </ul>
       <!--imgten-->
    <h4> 6. Shut out criticism. </h4>
      <p> During the brainstorming process, criticism isn't helpful. You'll need the freedom of minimal boundaries in order to get to new ideas. Leave criticism for once you have a long list of possibilities. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> If you're brainstorming with other people, you might need to remind some people to keep negative opinions to themselves until the brainstorming activity is done. </li>
      </ul>
    <h2> Part 3 <br /> Brainstorming Techniques </h2>
       <!--imgeleven-->
    <h4> 1. Warm up. </h4>
      <p> Don't try to brainstorm with just a cold start. This is like breaking out into a full run without a light jog first! Do a quick exercise that gets your head in that space, such as making a menu for your next week's worth of dinners, or coming up with a wish list of things you'd like to accomplish in work, school, or whatever it is you're doing. </p>
     <!--imgtwelve-->
    <h4> Change your perspective. </h4>
      <p> Put yourself in the shoes of your competitor, looking at what you're doing now and trying to figure out how to be better than you. How would they look at what you're doing and do things better? What would they change? Where would they go next? </p>
