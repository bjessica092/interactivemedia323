			<p>"Hope" is the thing with feathers -
				That perches in the soul -
				And sings the tune without the words -
				And never stops - at all -

				And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
				And sore must be the storm -
				That could abash the little Bird
				That kept so many warm -

				I've heard it in the chillest land -
				And on the strangest Sea -
				Yet - never - in Extremity,
				It asked a crumb - of me.
			</p>
