	<h1>"Hope" is the thing with feathers -
		That perches <br /><br /><span id="soul">in the soul -</span><br />
		And sings the tune without the words -
		And never stops - at all -

		And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
		And sore must be the storm -
		That could abash the little Bird
		That kept so many warm -

		I've heard it in the chillest land -
		And on the strangest Sea -
		Yet - never - in Extremity,
		It asked a crumb - of me.<br /><br /><br /></h1>
