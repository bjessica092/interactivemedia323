		<h2>"Hope" is the thing with feathers -</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>That perches in the soul -</li>
			<li>And sings the tune without the words -</li>
			<li>And never stops - at all -</li>
			<li>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>And sore must be the storm -</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>That could abash the little Bird</li>
			<li>That kept so many warm -</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>I've heard it in the chillest land</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>And on the strangest Sea -</li>
			<li>Yet - never - in Extremity,</li>
			<li>It asked a crumb - of me.</li>
		</ul>
